# LIRI-Bot


LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data. It is similar to SIRI but without voice recognition. The app will incorporate Spotify, Bands in Town, and OMDB API data to pull information about music, concerts, and movies.
